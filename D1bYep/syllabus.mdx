# Deep Learning Fundamentals

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! 

We are excited to present you with the initial draft of your experience. This experience will provide you with a comprehensive understanding of deep learning, starting from the core concepts and progressing to more advanced topics. Each week will build upon the knowledge gained in the previous weeks, ensuring a logical and structured learning journey.

## The Group Experience

Once a week, you will have the opportunity to participate in an immersive experience with your group. These sessions will vary between hands-on workshops, intense hackathons, and stimulating discussions. This collaborative environment will allow you to learn from your peers and gain practical experience in applying the concepts covered.

Additionally, you will have one-on-one challenge-solving sessions with a fellow group member, rotating partners every week. This will provide you with a diverse range of perspectives and foster a dynamic learning environment.

## Outcomes

By the end of this experience, you will have acquired the following core knowledge and skills:

- Understanding of the core concepts of deep learning
