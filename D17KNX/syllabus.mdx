# Data Science Foundations

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! 

I will try to avoid marketing jargon and get straight to the point.

Our team just finished preparing for you the initial draft of your experience. We built it using our new model and we designed it based on your application to tailor it as closely to your needs as possible. But still, we would love to hear your feedback and anything you have to add! Just to clarify - This is only the overview of the experience, not the experience itself.

## Overview
In this experience, we will start by building a strong foundation in data science concepts. We will cover the basics and gradually move towards more advanced topics. Each week will build upon the knowledge gained in the previous weeks, ensuring a logical progression of skills and understanding.

## The Group Experience
Once a week, you will meet with your group for an immersive experience. Each session will be a hands-on workshop, an intense hackathon, or a stimulating discussion. These sessions will provide practical application of the concepts learned and foster collaboration and problem-solving skills. Additionally, you will have one-on-one challenge-solving sessions with a fellow group member, rotating partners every week to keep things fresh.

## Outcomes
- Develop a basic understanding of data science concepts
- Familiarity with general data science concepts
- Ability to apply data science concepts

## The Roadmap

### Week 1: Introduction to Data Science
This week will provide an introduction to data science and its applications. We will cover the basic concepts and principles of data science, including data collection, cleaning, and exploration. The objective for this week is to develop a basic understanding of data science concepts.

### Week 2: Advanced Data Science Concepts
Building upon the knowledge gained in the previous week, we will dive deeper into advanced data science concepts. Topics covered will include data visualization, statistical analysis, and hypothesis testing. The objective for this week is to further enhance familiarity with general data science concepts.

### Week 3: Applying Data Science Concepts
In this week, we will focus on applying the data science concepts learned in the previous weeks. We will work on real-world datasets and use various techniques to extract insights and make data-driven decisions. The objective for this week is to develop the ability to apply data science concepts.

### Week 4: Introduction to Machine Learning
Moving on to machine learning, this week will provide an introduction to the basic concepts and principles of machine learning. We will cover different types of machine learning algorithms and their applications. The objective for this week is to develop a basic understanding of machine learning concepts.

### Week 5: Advanced Machine Learning Concepts
Building upon the knowledge gained in the previous week, we will delve deeper into advanced machine learning concepts. Topics covered will include model evaluation, feature engineering, and model selection. The objective for this week is to further enhance familiarity with general machine learning concepts.

### Week 6: Applying Machine Learning Concepts
In this week, we will focus on applying the machine learning concepts learned in the previous weeks. We will work on real-world datasets, build machine learning models, and evaluate their performance. The objective for this week is to develop the ability to apply machine learning concepts.

### Week 7: Introduction to Pandas and Numpy
Moving on to practical tools for data manipulation and analysis, this week will introduce Pandas and Numpy. We will cover the basics of these libraries and learn how to use them for data preprocessing and exploration. The objective for this week is to develop a limited knowledge of Pandas and Numpy.

### Week 8: Familiarity with Pandas and Numpy
Building upon the knowledge gained in the previous week, we will explore more advanced features and functionalities of Pandas and Numpy. We will learn how to handle missing data, perform advanced data manipulations, and apply mathematical operations. The objective for this week is to develop an awareness of the existence of Pandas and Numpy.

### Week 9: Practical Use of Pandas and Numpy
In this final week, we will focus on practical applications of Pandas and Numpy. We will work on real-world datasets, apply Pandas and Numpy to perform data analysis and manipulation tasks, and gain hands-on experience. The objective for this week is to gain practical knowledge in using Pandas and Numpy.

We look forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback!
