# Week 3: Advanced Topics in Language Modeling

## Week Overview

During Week 3, we will dive deeper into language modeling and sequence-to-sequence tasks. We will explore advanced techniques and algorithms used in NLP projects. This week's topics are crucial for developing a solid understanding of language modeling and its relevance to various NLP applications. By the end of this week, you will have a more comprehensive understanding of how language modeling is applied in real-world scenarios.

These topics also build upon what we discussed in the previous weeks, allowing us to continue exploring the field of NLP and expand our knowledge and skillset.

## Week Outcomes

By the end of this week, you are expected to acquire the following skills and knowledge:

- Implementing advanced algorithms and techniques used in language modeling.
- Gaining a deep understanding of the foundational concepts and theories behind language modeling.
- Applying the acquired knowledge to build more complex projects or components.
- Continuation of ongoing projects with a stronger focus on language modeling.
- Effectively articulating ideas and concepts related to advanced language modeling techniques.
- Engaging in practical application challenges to further enhance your skills and problem-solving abilities in the language modeling domain.
