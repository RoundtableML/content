# Week 2: Hands-on Sprint Project - Building a Sentiment Analysis Model

## Week Overview

This week, we will be focusing on building a sentiment analysis model. We will apply the knowledge and skills that we learned in Week 1 to implement deep learning models for NLP tasks. By working on practical exercises and coding, we will enhance our understanding of key principles and gain valuable hands-on experience in sentiment analysis.

Building a sentiment analysis model is an important task in natural language processing. It involves analyzing text data and determining the sentiment or emotional tone behind it, whether it is positive, negative, or neutral. This skill is widely used in various domains such as social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and market research.

Throughout the week, we will learn about different approaches and techniques for sentiment analysis, including using neural networks and deep learning models. We will also explore the challenges involved in implementing these models and how to overcome them.

This week's project is designed to strengthen our skills in implementing deep learning models for NLP tasks. It will provide us with hands-on experience and enable us to apply our knowledge to a real-world problem. By the end of this week, we will have a solid understanding of sentiment analysis and be able to successfully build a sentiment analysis model.

## Week Outcomes

By the end of this week, you are expected to:

- Implement deep learning models for sentiment analysis.
- Understand the principles and techniques used in sentiment analysis.
- Apply your knowledge and skills to build a sentiment analysis model.
- Overcome challenges in implementing deep learning models for NLP tasks.
- Gain hands-on experience in implementing NLP models.
- Demonstrate effective articulation of ideas and concepts related to sentiment analysis.
