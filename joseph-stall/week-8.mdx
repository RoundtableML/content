# Week 8: Hands-on Sprint Project - Text Generation with Transformer Models

## Week Overview

In this hands-on sprint project, you will be enhancing your skills by building a text generation model using transformer models. This project will focus on deepening your understanding of transformer models and their application in NLP tasks.

As an AI researcher and software engineer, this project is designed to provide you with practical experience in implementing transformer models for text generation. By the end of this week, you will have a better understanding of how transformer models work and how they can be used in NLP tasks.

## Week Outcomes

By the end of this week, you are expected to acquire the following skills and knowledge:

- Implementing transformer models for text generation
- Understanding the architecture and working principles of transformer models
- Applying transformer models in NLP tasks
- Enhancing your practical skills in AI research and software engineering
- Strengthening your ability to articulate ideas and concepts effectively

This project will provide you with valuable hands-on experience and help you further develop your expertise in natural language processing and AI research.
