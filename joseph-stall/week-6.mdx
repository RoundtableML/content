# Week 6: Capstone Project Phase 3 - Evaluation and Iteration

## Week Overview

This week, we will focus on evaluating the performance of your model and iteratively refining it to enhance its effectiveness. This phase is crucial in developing proficiency in applying language modeling and sequence-to-sequence tasks in practical NLP projects. By the end of this week, you will have a comprehensive understanding of how to evaluate and improve the performance of your NLP model.

We will build upon the concepts and techniques learned in previous weeks and apply them to your capstone project. You will evaluate the performance of your model using various evaluation metrics and techniques. You will also learn how to interpret the results and make informed decisions to enhance the effectiveness of your model.

## Week Outcomes

By the end of this week, you are expected to acquire the following skills and knowledge:

- Evaluate the performance of your NLP model using appropriate evaluation metrics.
- Interpret the evaluation results and identify areas for improvement.
- Implement iterative refinement techniques to enhance the effectiveness of your model.
- Apply language modeling and sequence-to-sequence tasks to practical NLP projects.
- Continue working on your ongoing capstone project and incorporate the evaluation and refinement process into it.

This week will challenge you to think critically and make data-driven decisions to improve your NLP model. It is essential to articulate your ideas and concepts effectively to communicate your findings and improvements.
