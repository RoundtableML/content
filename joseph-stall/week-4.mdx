# Week 4: Capstone Project Phase 1 - Problem Identification and Research

## Week Overview

In Week 4, we will embark on the first phase of our capstone project. This phase is all about problem identification and conducting research to understand existing approaches and potential solutions in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). We will focus on identifying a challenging problem in NLP and formulating it in a clear and concise manner. By the end of this week, we should have a solid understanding of the problem and potential avenues for solution.

This phase aligns perfectly with our goal of applying our knowledge to real-world problems and developing innovative approaches. It builds upon the foundational concepts and techniques we have learned so far in the course and provides an opportunity to put them into practice through the capstone project.

## Week Outcomes

By the end of Week 4, you should be able to:

- Identify a challenging problem in the field of NLP.
- Conduct research to understand existing approaches and potential solutions for the identified problem.
- Formulate the identified problem in a clear and concise manner.
- Analyze and evaluate the feasibility of different approaches for solving the problem.
- Apply your knowledge of NLP and related techniques to real-world problems.
- Develop innovative approaches for solving the identified problem.

Through this week's activities, you will not only enhance your technical skills in NLP and research, but also develop critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. This will be crucial as we continue to work on our capstone project and tackle more complex challenges in the field of NLP. Keep up the great work, Joseph Stall!
