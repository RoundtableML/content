# Week 5: Capstone Project Phase 2 - Model Design and Implementation

## Week Overview

In Week 5, we will focus on the design and implementation of your model for the capstone project. This phase of the project is crucial as it allows us to address the identified problem and apply our skills in deep learning models and language modeling to create an effective solution. By working hands-on, we will reinforce our understanding of the learned concepts and gain practical experience in applying them to real-world problems.

The design and implementation of the model will require us to consider various factors such as the input data, the specific problem we are trying to solve, and the desired output. We will explore different techniques and approaches in deep learning and language modeling to find the most effective solution.

This week's topics build upon the foundation we laid in the previous weeks, particularly in the areas of deep learning models and language modeling. It will provide us with an opportunity to further enhance our understanding and apply the concepts we have learned in a practical setting.

## Week Outcomes

By the end of this week, you are expected to:

- Design and implement a model to address the identified problem in the capstone project.
- Apply deep learning models and language modeling techniques effectively.
- Gain hands-on experience in implementing and evaluating the performance of the model.
- Reinforce your understanding of deep learning and language modeling concepts.
- Demonstrate the practical application of the learned concepts to real-world problems.

This week's activities will challenge us to think critically and creatively, and to apply our knowledge and skills to the ongoing capstone project. It is an opportunity for us to showcase our abilities and contribute to the development of an effective solution. Let's make the most of this week and continue to build upon our progress. Good luck, Joseph Stall!
