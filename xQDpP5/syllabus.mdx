# Data Science Foundations

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! 

We are excited to present you with the initial draft of your experience in Data Science Foundations. This experience is designed to provide you with a solid foundation in the key concepts and techniques used in data science. Each week builds upon the previous one, allowing you to gradually advance your knowledge and skills.

## The Group Experience
Once a week, you will have the opportunity to participate in an immersive experience with your group. These sessions can take the form of hands-on workshops, intense hackathons, or stimulating discussions. Your weekends will never be the same! Additionally, you will have one-on-one challenge-solving sessions with a fellow group member, rotating partners every week to keep things fresh.

## Outcomes
By the end of this experience, you will have acquired the following core knowledge and skills:
- Solid understanding of linear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics
- Proficiency in supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning
- Ability to clean and normalize data, perform feature selection and extraction, and evaluate models using cross-validation and evaluation metrics
- Familiarity with basic Python syntax, data manipulation with pandas, and machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch
- Knowledge of hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, regression analysis, and various visualization techniques
- Understanding of deep learning frameworks, text preprocessing, time series analysis, and distributed computing frameworks
- Experience with AWS, GCP, and Microsoft Azure, as well as gradient descent and optimization algorithms
- Ability to formulate and solve problems, collect and preprocess data, and select and evaluate models
- Awareness of bias, fairness, privacy, security, transparency, and interpretability in machine learning
- Proficiency in model interpretation techniques and effective communication of findings

## The Roadmap

### Week 1: Foundations of Data Science
In this week, we will lay the groundwork for your data science journey. We will cover the basics of linear algebra, calculus, and probability and statistics. The objectives for this week include understanding matrix operations, derivatives, integrals, probability distributions, and statistical measures.

### Week 2: Introduction to Machine Learning
Building upon the foundations from Week 1, we will dive into the world of machine learning. We will explore supervised learning algorithms and their applications. The objectives for this week include implementing and evaluating regression and classification models.

### Week 3: Unsupervised Learning and Data Preprocessing
This week, we will shift our focus to unsupervised learning techniques and the importance of data preprocessing. We will cover clustering algorithms, dimensionality reduction, and data cleaning techniques. The objectives for this week include applying clustering algorithms and performing data cleaning and normalization.

### Week 4: Advanced Machine Learning Techniques
In Week 4, we will explore advanced machine learning techniques such as semi-supervised learning, transfer learning, and reinforcement learning. We will also discuss the bias-variance tradeoff and model evaluation metrics. The objectives for this week include implementing semi-supervised and reinforcement learning algorithms and understanding model evaluation metrics.

### Week 5: Deep Learning and Neural Networks
This week, we will delve into the exciting world of deep learning and neural networks. We will cover artificial neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks. The objectives for this week include implementing and training neural network models.

### Week 6: Natural Language Processing and Time Series Analysis
In Week 6, we will explore the application of machine learning techniques to text data and time series analysis. We will cover text preprocessing, text classification, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, time series decomposition, and ARIMA models. The objectives for this week include preprocessing text data, building text classification models, and analyzing time series data.

### Week 7: Reinforcement Learning and Decision Making
Building upon the reinforcement learning concepts introduced in Week 4, we will dive deeper into reinforcement learning algorithms such as Markov decision processes, Q-learning, and policy gradients. The objectives for this week include implementing reinforcement learning algorithms and understanding their applications in decision making.

### Week 8: Big Data and Distributed Computing
In this final week, we will explore the challenges and techniques involved in working with big data. We will cover distributed computing frameworks such as Hadoop and Spark, as well as data parallelism and MapReduce. The objectives for this week include understanding distributed computing frameworks and implementing parallel processing techniques.

We hope you find this overview helpful and we look forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback!
