# Week 5: Sprint Project - Advanced Object Detection Techniques

## Week Overview

This week, we will be focusing on advanced object detection techniques to enhance your skills in this area. We will specifically explore algorithms such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) and SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) and learn how to implement them in your smart eyeglasses prototype. By working on this sprint project, you will deepen your understanding of key principles in object detection and further improve your proficiency in this field. This topic is significant as it allows you to apply your knowledge of computer vision and machine learning to develop cutting-edge technology.

The topics covered in this week's sprint project are interlinked with the overall syllabus objectives as they build upon the foundational concepts we have learned so far in computer vision, machine learning, and programming. By implementing advanced object detection techniques, you will enhance your ability to create intelligent systems that can detect and recognize objects in real-time scenarios.

## Week Outcomes

By the end of this week, you are expected to acquire the following skills and knowledge:

- Implementing advanced object detection algorithms such as YOLO and SSD.
- Understanding the principles behind these algorithms and how they contribute to real-time object detection.
- Enhancing your programming skills in Python and relevant libraries for computer vision.
- Applying your knowledge of machine learning to train and fine-tune object detection models.
- Integrating object detection techniques into your smart eyeglasses prototype.
- Continuously working on your ongoing project and making progress towards its completion.

Throughout this week, you will face practical application challenges that will test your understanding of the concepts and algorithms learned. These challenges will provide opportunities for you to apply your knowledge to real-world scenarios and further strengthen your problem-solving skills in the field of computer vision and object detection.
