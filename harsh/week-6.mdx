# Week 6-10: Capstone Project - Real-world Object Detection Application

## Week Overview

Welcome to the final phase of our syllabus, Harsh! In this capstone project, we will be focusing on a real-world object detection application. We will work on a specific learning goal aligned with your objectives, developing an innovative application that utilizes your smart eyeglasses prototype. This is an exciting opportunity for you to showcase your skills and knowledge by building a practical solution to a real-world problem.

Throughout this syllabus, we have provided you with theoretical learning and practical hands-on exercises to reinforce your understanding of the subject matter. This week, we will continue building upon what we have learned so far, with a specific focus on object detection and its application in real-time.

## Week Outcomes

By the end of this week, you are expected to acquire the following skills and knowledge:

- Implementing object detection algorithms or techniques.
- Understanding the foundational concepts of object detection.
- Building a real-world object detection application using your smart eyeglasses prototype.
- Continuation of your ongoing project, applying object detection to enhance its functionality.
- Articulating your ideas and concepts effectively in the context of real-world object detection.
- Facing practical application challenges and overcoming them through problem-solving and critical thinking.

This week will provide you with the opportunity to delve deeper into computer vision and apply your knowledge to solve a real-world problem. Get ready to make great strides towards achieving your objectives, Harsh, and explore the exciting world of computer vision!

## Week Social Activities

1. **One-on-One Interactions:**
   For the one-on-one sessions, each student will be assigned a partner for a 1-hour session. The objective of these sessions is to provide peer learning and collaboration. The desired outcomes for the sessions can include preparing a presentation, coding session, discussion, reviewing material, or any other activity related to the capstone project. In case of an odd number of members, one subgroup will consist of 3 members. Each pair should have a different task assigned to their one-on-one session. This will encourage knowledge sharing and allow students to learn from each other's expertise.

2. **Weekly Group Session:**
   The weekly group session will be a 1-hour interactive session where all the students will come together to share their progress and engage in collaborative activities. The agenda for the session will include presentation slots of 10 minutes for each member to share their screen and showcase their work. Along with the presentations, there will be interactive segments such as quizzes, workshops, or discussions to foster peer learning. Assigning roles among students for the group session will enhance participation and ensure efficient management of the session. The roles can include a discussion leader, who will guide the discussion and facilitate interactions, and a note-taker, who will summarize the key points discussed during the session.

3. **Preparation and Participation:**
   To ensure active participation and meaningful discussions during the group session, a checklist of materials to be reviewed and preparatory tasks will be provided to each student. This will help them prepare and come prepared with relevant insights and questions for the session. Students will be encouraged to actively contribute to the discussions and activities by sharing their experiences, asking questions, providing feedback, and offering suggestions. This will create a collaborative learning environment where everyone can benefit from each other's perspectives and expertise.

By implementing these social activities, the study group will foster peer learning and collaboration without the need for a mentor or instructor. This approach will empower students to take ownership of their learning, enhance their problem-solving and critical thinking skills, and build a supportive community where they can learn from each other's strengths.
