# Week 6-10: Capstone Project - Real-world Object Detection Application

## Week Overview

Welcome to the final phase of our syllabus, Harsh! In this capstone project, we will be focusing on a real-world object detection application. We will work on a specific learning goal aligned with your objectives, developing an innovative application that utilizes your smart eyeglasses prototype. This is an exciting opportunity for you to showcase your skills and knowledge by building a practical solution to a real-world problem.

Throughout this syllabus, we have provided you with theoretical learning and practical hands-on exercises to reinforce your understanding of the subject matter. This week, we will continue building upon what we have learned so far, with a specific focus on object detection and its application in real-time.

## Week Outcomes

By the end of this week, you are expected to acquire the following skills and knowledge:

- Implementing object detection algorithms or techniques.
- Understanding the foundational concepts of object detection.
- Building a real-world object detection application using your smart eyeglasses prototype.
- Continuation of your ongoing project, applying object detection to enhance its functionality.
- Articulating your ideas and concepts effectively in the context of real-world object detection.
- Facing practical application challenges and overcoming them through problem-solving and critical thinking.

This week will provide you with the opportunity to delve deeper into computer vision and apply your knowledge to solve a real-world problem. Get ready to make great strides towards achieving your objectives, Harsh, and explore the exciting world of computer vision!
