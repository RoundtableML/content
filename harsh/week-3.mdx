# Week 3: Enhancing Object Detection Capabilities

## Week Overview

This week, we will focus on further enhancing your object detection capabilities by exploring advanced techniques. We will delve into feature extraction and matching, as well as techniques such as background subtraction and contour detection. These techniques are crucial in improving the performance of your object detection system.

By understanding feature extraction and matching, you will be able to extract relevant features from images and match them to identify objects accurately. Additionally, background subtraction will help you to differentiate between the foreground and background, allowing for better object detection. Finally, contour detection will aid in identifying the boundaries of objects, providing more precise detection results.

This week's topics are directly related to the previous week's content on object detection. By building upon the foundations laid last week, you will gain a deeper understanding of the different techniques involved in object detection. These advanced techniques will enable you to refine your object detection system and improve its overall performance.

## Week Outcomes

By the end of this week, you are expected to acquire the following skills and knowledge:

- Implementing feature extraction and matching algorithms to identify objects accurately.
- Understanding the concept and practical application of background subtraction in object detection.
- Utilizing contour detection techniques to identify the boundaries of objects.
- Refining your object detection system using advanced techniques.
- Improving the overall performance of your object detection system.

Through practical exercises, you will have the opportunity to apply these techniques in real-world scenarios and further enhance your object detection capabilities. This will allow you to tackle practical application challenges more effectively and articulate your ideas and concepts in the field of object detection.
