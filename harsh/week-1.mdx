# Week 1: Introduction to Computer Vision and Object Detection

## Week Overview

This week, we will begin our journey into the field of computer vision and focus on the concept of object detection. We will discuss the fundamental concepts and theories underlying computer vision and explore various object detection techniques. Additionally, we will familiarize ourselves with the frame differencing technique, which is commonly used in object detection. 

Understanding computer vision and object detection is essential as it forms the basis for many advanced applications in fields such as autonomous driving, surveillance systems, and image recognition. By gaining a solid understanding of these concepts, we will be equipped with the necessary knowledge to tackle more complex computer vision tasks in the future.

This week's topics will build upon what we learned last week, where we explored the basics of computer vision and its applications. We will delve deeper into the theoretical aspects of computer vision and start applying our knowledge through hands-on exercises.

## Week Outcomes

By the end of this week, you are expected to:

- Understand the foundational concepts and theories of computer vision.
- Gain knowledge about various object detection techniques.
- Familiarize yourself with the frame differencing technique for object detection.
- Implement basic object detection algorithms.
- Apply your understanding of computer vision to solve practical challenges.
- Effectively articulate ideas and concepts related to computer vision and object detection.

We will continue working on our ongoing project throughout the week, applying the newly acquired knowledge to enhance our project's computer vision capabilities.


## Week Social Activities

To encourage peer learning and collaboration without the need for a mentor or instructor, we can implement the following social plan for the study group:

1. One-on-One Interactions:
   - Assign each student a partner for a 1-hour one-on-one session.
   - Provide a clear objective for each session, such as preparing a presentation, coding session, discussion, reviewing material, etc.
   - Desired outcomes should be defined for each session to ensure progress and learning.
   - In case of an odd number of members, create one sub-group of 3 members.
   - Each pair should have a different task for their one-on-one session to promote diverse learning experiences.

2. Weekly Group Session:
   - Conduct a 1-hour group session every week.
   - Develop an agenda for the session to ensure a structured approach.
   - Allocate presentation slots of 10 minutes for each member to share their screen and demonstrate their progress or learnings.
   - Include interactive segments like quizzes, workshops, or discussion forums to engage all members.
   - Assign roles among students for the group session, such as discussion leader and note-taker.
   - Briefly describe each role's responsibilities:
     - Discussion Leader: Facilitates the group session, ensures everyone's involvement, and manages the flow of discussion.
     - Note-taker: Takes notes during the session, consolidates key points, and shares them with the group afterward.

3. Preparation and Participation:
   - Create a checklist of materials to be reviewed and preparatory tasks to be completed before the group session.
   - Encourage active participation by detailing how each student can contribute to the discussions and activities.
   - Assign specific reading materials or resources to be explored individually before the group session.
   - Encourage students to share their findings or insights during the discussions.
   - Promote asking questions, seeking clarification, and providing constructive feedback to enhance learning.

With this social plan, the study group will have dedicated one-on-one sessions for personalized learning experiences. The weekly group session will provide a platform for knowledge sharing, interactive activities, and discussions. By emphasizing preparation and active participation, students will take ownership of their learning and collaborate effectively without the need for external guidance.
