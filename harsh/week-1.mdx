# Week 1: Introduction to Computer Vision and Object Detection

## Week Overview

This week, we will begin our journey into the field of computer vision and focus on the concept of object detection. We will discuss the fundamental concepts and theories underlying computer vision and explore various object detection techniques. Additionally, we will familiarize ourselves with the frame differencing technique, which is commonly used in object detection.

Understanding computer vision and object detection is essential as it forms the basis for many advanced applications in fields such as autonomous driving, surveillance systems, and image recognition. By gaining a solid understanding of these concepts, we will be equipped with the necessary knowledge to tackle more complex computer vision tasks in the future.

This week's topics will build upon what we learned last week, where we explored the basics of computer vision and its applications. We will delve deeper into the theoretical aspects of computer vision and start applying our knowledge through hands-on exercises.

## Week Outcomes

By the end of this week, you are expected to:

- Understand the foundational concepts and theories of computer vision.
- Gain knowledge about various object detection techniques.
- Familiarize yourself with the frame differencing technique for object detection.
- Implement basic object detection algorithms.
- Apply your understanding of computer vision to solve practical challenges.
- Effectively articulate ideas and concepts related to computer vision and object detection.

We will continue working on our ongoing project throughout the week, applying the newly acquired knowledge to enhance our project's computer vision capabilities.
