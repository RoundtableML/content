# Week 2: Implementation of Frame Differencing Technique

## Week Overview

This week, we will focus on learning and applying the frame differencing technique using Python and OpenCV. This technique allows us to process video streams and detect objects by comparing consecutive frames. By implementing the frame differencing technique, we will be able to build a basic object detection system.

The frame differencing technique is an important concept in computer vision and is widely used in various applications such as motion detection, video surveillance, and object tracking. Understanding this technique will provide a solid foundation for future topics related to computer vision and image processing.

Throughout the week, we will have hands-on exercises where you will get to implement the frame differencing technique. This will give you practical experience and help reinforce the concepts discussed in the lectures.

This week's topic builds upon the knowledge and skills acquired in the previous week. We will continue to explore Python and OpenCV, but now with a focus on applying the frame differencing technique for object detection. It is crucial to understand this technique as it forms the basis for more advanced computer vision algorithms and systems.

## Week Outcomes

By the end of this week, you are expected to:

- Understand the frame differencing technique and its application in object detection.
- Implement the frame differencing technique using Python and OpenCV.
- Build a basic object detection system using the frame differencing technique.
- Apply the frame differencing technique to real-world video streams.
- Gain practical experience in processing video streams and detecting objects.

These outcomes will further strengthen your understanding of computer vision concepts and provide you with the necessary skills for future projects and challenges.
