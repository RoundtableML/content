# Week 2: Implementation of Frame Differencing Technique

## Week Overview

This week, we will focus on learning and applying the frame differencing technique using Python and OpenCV. This technique allows us to process video streams and detect objects by comparing consecutive frames. By implementing the frame differencing technique, we will be able to build a basic object detection system.

The frame differencing technique is an important concept in computer vision and is widely used in various applications such as motion detection, video surveillance, and object tracking. Understanding this technique will provide a solid foundation for future topics related to computer vision and image processing.

Throughout the week, we will have hands-on exercises where you will get to implement the frame differencing technique. This will give you practical experience and help reinforce the concepts discussed in the lectures.

This week's topic builds upon the knowledge and skills acquired in the previous week. We will continue to explore Python and OpenCV, but now with a focus on applying the frame differencing technique for object detection. It is crucial to understand this technique as it forms the basis for more advanced computer vision algorithms and systems.

## Week Outcomes

By the end of this week, you are expected to:

- Understand the frame differencing technique and its application in object detection.
- Implement the frame differencing technique using Python and OpenCV.
- Build a basic object detection system using the frame differencing technique.
- Apply the frame differencing technique to real-world video streams.
- Gain practical experience in processing video streams and detecting objects.

These outcomes will further strengthen your understanding of computer vision concepts and provide you with the necessary skills for future projects and challenges.

## Week Social Activities

To create a study group that encourages peer learning and collaboration without the need for a mentor or instructor, the following social plan is proposed:

1. **One-on-One Interactions:**

- Assign each student a partner for a 1-hour one-on-one session.
- Provide a clear objective for each session and desired outcomes, such as preparing a presentation, coding session, discussing material, or reviewing concepts.
- In case of an odd number of members, create one sub-group with three members.
- Each pair should have a different task for their one-on-one session.

Example:

- John and Jenna will have a coding session to implement the frame differencing technique using Python and OpenCV.
- George and Jasmin will prepare a presentation on the application of the frame differencing technique in object detection.
- Harsh will have a discussion session with the mentor to review the material and clarify doubts.

2. **Weekly Group Session:**

- Develop an agenda for a 1-hour group session.
- Allocate presentation slots of 10 minutes for each member to share their screen and present their work or findings.
- Incorporate interactive segments such as quizzes, workshops, or discussion forums.
- Assign roles among students for the group session, such as a discussion leader and note-taker, and provide a brief description of each role's responsibilities.

Example:

- Group Session Agenda:

  - Introduction and announcements (5 minutes)
  - Presentation by John on the implementation of the frame differencing technique (10 minutes)
  - Interactive segment: Quiz on the frame differencing technique (10 minutes)
  - Presentation by Jenna on the challenges faced during the coding session (10 minutes)
  - Discussion forum led by George on the potential applications of frame differencing in various industries (15 minutes)
  - Workshop on troubleshooting code-related issues facilitated by Jasmin (10 minutes)
  - Recap and plan for the next week (5 minutes)

- Roles:
  - Discussion leader: George will facilitate the discussion forum by encouraging participation, managing time, and ensuring everyone's input is valued.
  - Note-taker: Jasmin will document important points discussed during the group session and share the notes with all members afterward.

3. **Preparation and Participation:**

- Create a checklist of materials to be reviewed and preparatory tasks to be completed before the group session.
- Encourage active participation by detailing how each student can contribute to the discussions and activities.

Example:

- Checklist:

  - Review lecture slides on the frame differencing technique.
  - Implement the frame differencing technique using Python and OpenCV following the provided code examples.
  - Prepare a presentation or demonstration of the implementation.
  - Compile a list of challenges faced during the coding session to discuss during the group session.

- Participation:
  - John: Actively participate in the coding session and address any challenges faced.
  - Jenna: Prepare a comprehensive presentation on the implementation of the frame differencing technique.
  - George: Research and gather information on the potential applications of frame differencing in different industries for the discussion forum.
  - Jasmin: Facilitate the workshop on troubleshooting code-related issues and actively participate in discussions.
  - Harsh: Review the material and come prepared with questions and doubts for the one-on-one discussion session with the mentor.

By following this social plan, the study group will foster collaboration and peer learning, allowing each member to take ownership of their learning journey and contribute to the overall understanding of the frame differencing technique and its application in object detection.
