# Natural Language Processing Foundations

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! 

We are excited to present you with the initial draft of your experience. This experience is designed to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and equip you with the necessary skills to excel in this field. Each week builds upon the previous one, ensuring a logical progression of knowledge and skills.

## The Group Experience

Once a week, you will participate in an immersive experience with your group. These sessions will vary between hands-on workshops, intense hackathons, and stimulating discussions. This collaborative environment will allow you to learn from your peers, share ideas, and tackle challenges together. Additionally, you will have one-on-one challenge-solving sessions with a different group member each week, fostering a dynamic learning experience.

Your weekends will never be the same ðŸ˜‰

- Technical abilities in Natural Language Processing
- Formal training in Natural Language Processing

## The Roadmap

### Week 1: Introduction to Natural Language Processing
In this week, you will be introduced to the fundamentals of Natural Language Processing. You will learn about the principles and techniques used in NLP and gain an understanding of its applications in various domains. The key topics covered include an overview of NLP, its challenges, and the basic components of an NLP pipeline.

### Week 2: Algorithms and Models in NLP
Building upon the foundation laid in the previous week, you will dive deeper into the different algorithms and models used in NLP. You will explore techniques such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition. The objectives for this week include understanding the working principles of these algorithms and models and their applications in NLP tasks.

### Week 3: Tools and Libraries in NLP
In this week, you will familiarize yourself with the tools and libraries commonly used in NLP. You will learn how to leverage popular frameworks such as NLTK, spaCy, and TensorFlow to implement NLP solutions. The key topics covered include an overview of these tools, their features, and practical examples of their usage.

### Week 4: Programming Languages for NLP
Building upon your existing programming skills, this week focuses on the programming languages commonly used in NLP. You will gain proficiency in languages such as Python and Java, which are widely used for NLP tasks. The objectives for this week include understanding the syntax and features of these languages and implementing NLP algorithms using them.

### Week 5: Data Preprocessing and Cleaning in NLP
Data preprocessing and cleaning are crucial steps in NLP. In this week, you will learn various techniques to preprocess and clean textual data, including handling missing values, removing noise, and normalizing text. The key topics covered include data cleaning methods, feature engineering, and data transformation techniques.

### Week 6: Text Classification and Sentiment Analysis
Text classification and sentiment analysis are important NLP tasks. This week focuses on understanding the principles and techniques behind these tasks. You will learn about different classification algorithms, feature extraction methods, and evaluation metrics. The objectives for this week include implementing text classification and sentiment analysis models and evaluating their performance.

### Week 7: Information Extraction in NLP
Information extraction involves extracting structured information from unstructured text. In this week, you will explore techniques such as named entity recognition, relation extraction, and event extraction. The key topics covered include information extraction methods, entity linking, and knowledge graph construction.

### Week 8: Real-World Applications of NLP
In the final week, you will apply your knowledge and skills to real-world scenarios. You will work on practical projects that involve solving NLP challenges in domains such as healthcare, finance, and social media. The objectives for this week include implementing NLP techniques in real-world applications and gaining hands-on experience.

We hope this overview provides you with a clear understanding of the upcoming experience. We value your feedback and look forward to hearing your thoughts!
