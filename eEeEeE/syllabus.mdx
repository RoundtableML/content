# Frontend Development Experience

ðŸ‘‹ Hi Mndy Yandy! 

I will try to avoid marketing jargon and get straight to the point. 

Our team just finished preparing for you the initial draft of your experience. We built it using our new model and we designed it based on your application to tailor it as closely to your needs as possible. But still, we would love to hear your feedback and anything you have to add! **Just to clarify** - This is only the overview of the experience, not the experience itself.

## The Roadmap
Here is an outline of the roadmap and flow of the experience. Each part of the experience builds upon the previous one to advance your knowledge and skills.

## The Group Experience
Once a week, you will meet with your group for an immersive experience. Each session holds a different experience, whether it's a hands-on workshop, an intense hackathon, or a stimulating discussion. Your weekends will never be the same ðŸ˜‰. And there's more: you'll pair up with a fellow group member for a one-on-one challenge-solving session, rotating partners every week to keep things fresh.

## Outcomes
- Gain a solid understanding of frontend development principles and best practices.
- Develop proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Learn how to build interactive web applications using modern frameworks and libraries.
- Master the art of debugging and troubleshooting code.
- Acquire the skills to collaborate effectively with other developers and contribute to a team project.

### Week 1: Introduction to Web Development
In the first week, we will cover the basics of web development, including an introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You will learn about variables, data types, control structures (if statements, loops), and functions. The objective for this week is to establish a strong foundation in frontend development.

### Week 2: Building Interactive Web Pages
In the second week, we will dive deeper into frontend development by exploring object-oriented programming, error handling, and DOM manipulation. You will learn how to create dynamic web pages and handle user interactions. The objective for this week is to enhance your skills in building interactive web applications.

### Week 3: Introduction to Frameworks and Libraries
In the third week, we will introduce you to component-based architecture, state management, and routing. You will learn how to use frameworks like React and Angular to build scalable and maintainable web applications. The objective for this week is to familiarize yourself with modern frontend frameworks and their core concepts.

### Week 4: Advanced Frontend Development
In the fourth week, we will explore advanced topics such as virtual DOM, React hooks, and media queries. You will learn how to create responsive and mobile-friendly web applications. The objective for this week is to expand your knowledge and skills in frontend development.

### Week 5: Version Control and Collaboration
In the fifth week, we will focus on version control using Git and GitHub. You will learn how to create repositories, commit changes, and resolve conflicts. We will also cover code reviews and pull requests to foster collaborative problem-solving. The objective for this week is to equip you with the necessary skills for effective collaboration in a development team.

### Week 6: Accessibility and Usability
In the sixth week, we will delve into the importance of accessibility and usability in web development.

You will learn about input validation, cross-site scripting (XSS) prevention, secure password storage, and HTTPS. We will also cover security audits and vulnerability scanning. The objective for this week is to ensure that you can develop secure web applications and protect user data.

### Week 9: Data Structures and Algorithms
In the ninth week, we will dive into data structures and algorithms. You will learn about arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, sorting algorithms, and searching algorithms. We will also cover recursion and iteration. The objective for this week is to enhance your problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking.

### Week 10: Consuming APIs and Backend Integration
In the tenth week, we will focus on consuming APIs with JavaScript and integrating frontend applications with backend services. You will learn about RESTful API design principles, HTTP methods, authentication, and error handling. We will also cover API documentation tools like Swagger and Postman.
