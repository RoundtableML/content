# Frontend Development Experience

ðŸ‘‹ Hi Mndy Yandy! 

I will try to avoid marketing jargon and get straight to the point. 

Our team just finished preparing for you the initial draft of your experience. We built it using our new model and we designed it based on your application to tailor it as closely to your needs as possible. But still, we would love to hear your feedback and anything you have to add! **Just to clarify** - This is only the overview of the experience, not the experience itself.

## The Roadmap
Here is an outline of the roadmap and flow of the experience. Each part of the experience builds upon the previous one to advance your knowledge and skills.

## The Group Experience
Once a week, you will meet with your group for an immersive experience. Each session holds a different experience, whether it's a hands-on workshop, an intense hackathon, or a stimulating discussion. Your weekends will never be the same ðŸ˜‰. And there's more: you'll pair up with a fellow group member for a one-on-one challenge-solving session, rotating partners every week to keep things fresh.
