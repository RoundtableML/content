# Data Analyst Experience

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! 

I will try to avoid marketing jargon and get straight to the point.

Our team just finished preparing for you the initial draft of your experience. We built it using our new model and we designed it based on your application to tailor it as closely to your needs as possible. But still, we would love to hear your feedback and anything you have to add! **Just to clarify** - This is only the overview of the experience, not the experience itself.

## Overview
In this Data Analyst Experience, we will take you from having limited knowledge to developing a basic understanding of key topics in data analysis. Each week will build upon the previous one, allowing you to gradually expand your knowledge and skills. By the end of the experience, you will have acquired core knowledge and skills in data analysis.

## The Group Experience
Once a week, you will meet with your group for an immersive experience. Each session will offer a different activity, such as a hands-on workshop, an intense hackathon, or a stimulating discussion. These sessions will provide you with practical experience and opportunities to collaborate with your peers. Your weekends will never be the same ðŸ˜‰. Additionally, you will have one-on-one challenge-solving sessions with a fellow group member, rotating partners every week to keep things fresh.

## Outcomes
- Develop a basic understanding of data analysis
- Gain hands-on experience through workshops and hackathons
- Improve collaboration and problem-solving skills through one-on-one sessions
