# Experience Overview: Journey to Mastery in Coding, NLP, and Reinforcement Learning

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! 

I will try to avoid marketing jargon and get straight to the point.

Our team just finished preparing for you the initial draft of your experience. We built it using our new model and we designed it based on your application to tailor it as closely to your needs as possible. But still, we would love to hear your feedback and anything you have to add! **Just to clarify** - This is only the overview of the experience, not the experience itself.

## The Roadmap
Here's an outline of the roadmap and flow of the experience. Each part of the experience builds upon the previous one to advance your knowledge and skills.

1. Week 1: Understanding Core Coding Concepts
2. Week 2: Basic Coding Projects or Tasks
3. Week 3: Familiarity with Research Methodologies and Techniques
4. Week 4: Ability to Read and Understand Research Papers
5. Week 5: Knowledge and Understanding of Transformer Models
6. Week 6: Ability to Implement Basic Projects or Tasks related to Transformer Models
7. Week 7: Knowledge and Understanding of Natural Language Processing (NLP)
8. Week 8: Ability to Implement Basic Projects or Tasks related to NLP
9. Week 9: Knowledge and Understanding of Reinforcement Learning
10. Week 10: Ability to Implement Basic Projects or Tasks related to Reinforcement Learning

## The Group Experience
Once a week, you will meet with your group for an immersive experience. Each session holds a different experience, whether it's a hands-on workshop, an intense hackathon, or a stimulating discussion. Your weekends will never be the same ðŸ˜‰. And there's more: you'll pair up with a fellow group member for a one-on-one challenge-solving session, rotating partners every week to keep things fresh.
