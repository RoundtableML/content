# Experience Overview: AI Research and Development

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! 

I will try to avoid marketing jargon and get straight to the point.

Our team just finished preparing for you the initial draft of your experience. We built it using our new model and we designed it based on your application to tailor it as closely to your needs as possible. But still, we would love to hear your feedback and anything you have to add! Just to clarify - This is only the overview of the experience, not the experience itself.

## The Roadmap
The experience is structured in a logical sequence, with each week building upon the previous one to advance your knowledge and skills in AI research and development. Here's an outline of the roadmap and flow of the experience:

1. Week 1: Improved coding skills and core concepts understanding
2. Week 2: Basic projects or tasks to apply coding skills
3. Week 3: Knowledge and understanding of Transformer models
4. Week 4: Core concepts understanding of Natural Language Processing (NLP)
5. Week 5: Basic projects or tasks in NLP
6. Week 6: Knowledge and understanding of Reinforcement Learning
7. Week 7: Core concepts understanding of Reinforcement Learning
8. Week 8: Basic projects or tasks in Reinforcement Learning
9. Week 9: Familiarity with research methodologies and techniques
10. Week 10: Ability to read and understand research papers
11. Week 11: Ability to apply coding and research skills in practical projects
12. Week 12: Proficiency in core concepts of Transformer, NLP, and Reinforcement Learning
13. Week 13: Ability to implement basic projects or tasks related to these topics

## The Group Experience
Once a week, you will meet with your group for an immersive experience. Each session will offer a different experience, such as a hands-on workshop, an intense hackathon, or a stimulating discussion. Your weekends will never be the same ðŸ˜‰. Additionally, you'll pair up with a fellow group member for a one-on-one challenge-solving session, rotating partners every week to keep things fresh.

## Outcomes
By the end of this experience, you will acquire the following core knowledge and skills:

- Improved coding skills
- Understanding of core concepts in AI research and development
- Ability to work on basic projects or tasks in Transformer models, NLP, and Reinforcement Learning
- Familiarity with research methodologies and techniques
- Proficiency in implementing projects related to Transformer models, NLP, and Reinforcement Learning

### Week 1: Improved Coding Skills and Core Concepts Understanding
In the first week, we will focus on enhancing your coding skills and ensuring a solid understanding of core concepts in AI research and development. This will provide a strong foundation for the subsequent weeks.
